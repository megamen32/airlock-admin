# Agent Deliver API v1

`agent-deliver-v1` is the preferred machine-to-agent ingress. It reuses GPTAdmin Webhooks and Agent Herder; it does not introduce another webhook service or queue.

## Flow

```text
producer / MCP / cron / service
  -> GPTAdmin POST /webhooks/v1/agent-deliver-v1
  -> Agent Herder deliver(...)
  -> named agent session
  -> AI runtime
  -> optional terminal callback from GPTAdmin webhook job
```

Responsibilities:

- **GPTAdmin Webhooks**: HMAC auth, replay window, idempotency, durable job state, fixed routing, callback.
- **Agent Herder**: named session resolution/creation, activation policy, deferred mailbox and actual model delivery.
- **NoticePlace**: human notifications/incidents/approval/escalation, not generic machine event transport.

## Event

```json
{
  "schema": "gptadmin.agent-deliver.v1",
  "event_id": "telegram:5453051466:1524",
  "source": {
    "system": "telegram",
    "type": "message.created",
    "ref": "telegram:5453051466:1524"
  },
  "target": {
    "harness": "opencode",
    "name": "secretary-excode",
    "cwd": "/home/roomhacker/excode"
  },
  "subject": "Новое сообщение в ИИ-Бенчмарки",
  "payload": {},
  "delivery": {
    "create": "if_missing",
    "activation": "always",
    "mode": "sync"
  }
}
```

`delivery.create`: `if_missing` or `never`.

`delivery.activation`:

- `always`: process now and wake/start if needed;
- `if_running`: deliver only if the session is currently running, otherwise `skipped_inactive`;
- `defer`: persist for the next Herder-delivered turn without waking an inactive agent.

`delivery.mode`: `queue` or `sync`. Producers should normally submit asynchronously to GPTAdmin; using Herder `sync` does not block the producer because GPTAdmin returns `202` with a durable webhook job immediately. A successful webhook job/callback confirms the adapter's result, not necessarily a completed model turn: require `delivery=completed` for that claim. `skipped_inactive` and `deferred` are successful policy outcomes without a completed model turn; `queue` confirms enqueue acceptance.

The local adapter requires an absolute CWD resolving below `/home/roomhacker/` (including symlink resolution), a target name of at most 128 characters, the policy values listed above, and a rendered message of at most 32,000 UTF-8 bytes. Invalid inputs fail before calling Herder.

## Authentication and dedup

The live route uses HMAC signature v2 and `Idempotency-Key`. Producers should use one stable event identity for both `event_id` and `Idempotency-Key` when the source event has a durable ID.

The canonical HMAC input is:

```text
POST
/webhooks/v1/agent-deliver-v1
<unix timestamp>
<idempotency key>
<sha256 hex of request body>
```

Secrets are operator-managed and are not stored in source control.

## Telegram production producer

The existing Universal UserIO Telegram QR connector is the producer for chat `5453051466` (`ИИ-Бенчмарки`). The actual UserIO message IDs use Telegram peer form `-5453051466:<message id>`; the connector normalizes the peer ID before matching.

Only live `NewMessage` events are forwarded to the agent. Historical reconciliation/backfill is still written to UserIO but does not wake the agent. Outgoing Telegram messages are ignored by the existing `message.out` guard, preventing a secretary self-loop.

Target session:

```text
harness=opencode
name=secretary-excode
cwd=/home/roomhacker/excode
```

The production session is created once with its bootstrap instructions deferred; the first real live event flushes that bootstrap together with the event.

The Telegram producer uses `mode=sync`; GPTAdmin itself returns `202` immediately and executes the agent turn in its background webhook job. Terminal webhook callback receipts are HMAC-authenticated and persisted by the connector at:

```text
/var/lib/universal-userio/telegram-qr/agent-deliver-callbacks.jsonl
```

## ChatGPT targets

Existing ChatGPT conversations are available as Agent Herder sessions with `harness: "chatgpt"`. Their Herder identity workspace is `/home/roomhacker/.chatgpt`; this is an identity anchor, not a source-code working directory. The webhook adapter accepts named targets only: use exact title + that CWD with `create: "never"`. Addressing a known ChatGPT `sessionId` is supported by Herder directly, not by this webhook adapter. Automatic creation of a missing ChatGPT conversation is intentionally not enabled yet.

For `chatgpt`, `activation: "always"` / `resume_agent` continue the existing `/c/...` conversation through the same BrowserClaw-owned page. `activation: "if_running"` and `defer` keep the same generic Agent Herder semantics. The separate ChatGPT token driver is the preferred fast read path; BrowserClaw/CDP is the write/resume path.

The BrowserClaw transport is reached through server-100's localhost-only SSH tunnel at `127.0.0.1:39479` → Mac `127.0.0.1:9010`; do not bind integrations to the Mac app's changing internal `9210/9211` ports. The current app is `BrowserOS neo` (`com.browseros.BrowserClaw`). Herder retries the adapter every 30 seconds when the browser side is unavailable. A Mac GUI login is still required for the BrowserOS neo application itself; SSH cannot create an Aqua session at `loginwindow`.

## Telegram quiet-period trigger

The production Universal UserIO Telegram QR connector debounces agent delivery for the secretary instead of waking it on every message. The configured targets are `ИИ-Бенчмарки` (confirmed Telegram peer id `5453051466`) and exact Telegram title `EE Frontier`.

For either target, every incoming live `NewMessage` resets a 300-second quiet timer. Historical backfill does not schedule delivery, and outgoing Telegram messages are ignored by the existing `message.out` guard. After five minutes with no newer incoming message in that chat, the connector emits one `gptadmin.agent-deliver.v1` event to `secretary-excode`.

The trigger intentionally does **not** forward message text, sender identity, or attachments to the agent. It contains only chat metadata: `chat_id`, `chat_label`, `last_message_id`, number of messages observed in the burst, and `quiet_seconds`. The subject only states that new messages appeared. The secretary is expected to fetch and moderate the current chat context itself through UserIO/Telegram MCP.

Debounce state is persisted in `/var/lib/universal-userio/telegram-qr/agent-deliver-debounce.json` with mode 0600. If the connector restarts during a quiet window, it restores the pending burst and fires when the remaining quiet period expires. A failed `agent-deliver` attempt is retained and retried after another quiet interval instead of dropping the event.

## Legacy

`agent-wake-v1` remains temporarily available for compatibility. New integrations should use `agent-deliver-v1` and Agent Herder's `deliver` semantics. The word "wake" is no longer the preferred public abstraction because activation is only one delivery policy.

## Known relay issue

As of 2026-09-08, GPTAdmin's webhook dispatcher -> exposed child-MCP relay path can report a completed parent `mcp_call` while returning the child tool inventory/null instead of the child tool result. The production `agent-deliver-v1` route therefore uses GPTAdmin's fixed shell action to a narrow local adapter (`scripts/agent_deliver.py`), which calls the already-running local Agent Herder MCP directly and validates `ok=true`. This adapter is not a daemon, queue or alternative webhook service. Remove it after the generic child-MCP relay bug is fixed and revalidated.

BrowserOS neo 0.49.3.1 currently bundles BrowserClaw server 0.0.26 (migrations through `m0013`). On 2026-09-08 the local BrowserClaw DB had `m0014`–`m0016` applied by a newer server while those migration files were absent from 0.0.26, causing the embedded server to exit and proxy `9010` to return 503. After backing up the DB, the three empty/new schema changes were rolled back (`skills`, `skill_runs`, `skill_run_marks`, and empty `tasks.task_summary`), preserving historical sessions/dispatches; `PRAGMA integrity_check` returned `ok`. DB backup: `/Users/roomhacker/.gptadmin/file-backups/browserclaw-db-20260908-052917`.
