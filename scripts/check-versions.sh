# Validate version invariants across the repo.
#
# Always (intracommit invariant — runs in pre-commit hook + CI):
#   - Dockerfile.agent-builder ARG defaults match go.mod for the libs
#     we own (agentsdk, goai, sol). Drift here ships a published image
#     with stale lib source baked into /libs/, even though the image
#     tag claims the latest version.
#   - All ghcr image tags in docker-compose.yml are equal to each other.
#     Catches "bumped one line, forgot the others".
#   - The set of images published by .github/workflows/publish-images.yml
#     equals the set of images referenced (by basename) in
#     docker-compose.yml. Catches "added image to workflow but forgot
#     compose", and the regression of "removed `image:` from a compose
#     service so it silently went back to local-build only".
#   - README.md's `git checkout vX.Y.Z` install step matches the
#     compose ghcr tag. Operators clone + checkout the version the
#     README documents; if it drifts from compose, they pull a tag
#     that doesn't exist or whose images don't match the compose file.
#   - install.sh's pinned RELEASE_TAG default (and the README curl|bash
#     URLs that embed it) match the compose tag. The installer clones
#     this tag and pulls its images; a stale pin would fetch a tag whose
#     images don't exist or don't match.
#   - The README documents only STABLE releases. Pre-release tags
#     (-rc/-alpha/-beta/-dev) are rejected anywhere in the README, and
#     while compose pins a pre-release the README carries no install
#     quickstart at all (deferred to the stable release — proper
#     migrations aren't maintained for pre-releases). install.sh still
#     pins the pre-release verbatim; its own guard refuses to install one
#     without --pre-release.
#
# Release-only (RELEASE_TAG env set — runs in CI on tag push):
#   - Compose ghcr image tags equal $RELEASE_TAG. Catches "bumped to
#     wrong number" or "forgot to bump compose entirely before tagging".
#   - README.md's checkout version equals $RELEASE_TAG (stable tags only;
#     a pre-release tag has no README checkout line to match).
#   - install.sh RELEASE_TAG equals $RELEASE_TAG.
#
# Exit status: 0 on pass, 1 on any failure. All failures reported, not
# fail-fast — one run surfaces every drift.
