# airlock

Self-hosted platform for **cyborg agents** — programs that are half code, half AI. Fast and deterministic where they can be, AI-capable where they need to be.

Each agent runs as a long-lived Docker container with its own Postgres schema, S3 storage, web dashboard, custom HTTP routes (`{slug}.your-domain.com`), webhook ingress, cron scheduling, chat platform bridges (Telegram), and proxied access to LLMs and MCP tools. RBAC, real-time event streaming, full audit trail.

If "Heroku for cyborg agents, but I run it myself" lands, that's the shape.

> [!WARNING]
> **Alpha software.** This is early-release code with bugs we haven't found yet. Self-hosting works today and we use it ourselves, but you'll likely hit edge cases nobody else has. Take regular Postgres backups, treat each release as "test it before relying on it," and please [open an issue](https://github.com/airlockrun/airlock/issues) for anything that breaks.

## Quickstart

5 steps to a running self-hosted airlock instance.

**Prerequisites:**
- Linux server with Docker 24+ and the Compose v2 plugin
- A domain you control, with DNS administration access
- Ports 80 and 443 reachable from the public internet
- ~2 GB RAM, ~10 GB disk for a small install (more as agents and conversation history grow)

**Docker + Compose v2** — install per [Docker's official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (covers Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, Fedora, etc.). Compose v2 ships as a plugin alongside Docker Engine since 2022; the install guide includes it. On a fresh Ubuntu/Debian server, the [convenience script](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script) is the fastest path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER     # then log out/in so the group takes effect
docker compose version            # verify
```

Docker Desktop on macOS / Windows works for poking around but isn't suitable for a real self-host — you want a Linux server.

**Firewall (ports 80 + 443)** — on Ubuntu with UFW:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw status
```

Cloud providers (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, AWS, GCP, etc.) usually have their own firewall layer in addition to the OS — check their dashboard/security-group settings for the same two ports.

**Domain + wildcard DNS** — at your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Namecheap, Route 53, etc.), add an `A` record where the **name** field is `*.airlock` (or `*` if airlock.example.com is the apex) and the **value** is your server's public IP. The wildcard covers per-agent subdomains like `myagent.airlock.example.com` automatically. Cloudflare has a [walkthrough](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/) that maps cleanly to other providers' UIs.

Verify with `dig +short anything.airlock.example.com` once propagation completes (usually 1-5 min).

</details>

**Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/airlockrun/airlock
cd airlock

# 2. Generate secrets and edit configuration.
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env:
#   - Set DOMAIN to your real domain (e.g. airlock.example.com)
#   - Generate ENCRYPTION_KEY: openssl rand -hex 32
#   - Generate JWT_SECRET:     openssl rand -hex 32

# 3. Add a wildcard DNS A record at your DNS provider:
#       *.your-domain.com  →  <your server IP>
#    Caddy will use this to issue TLS certs from Let's Encrypt.

# 4. Bring everything up. First launch builds backend, frontend, and the
#    agent-builder/agent-base images (~3-5 min). Subsequent launches are
#    near-instant.
docker compose up -d

# 5. Get the first-run activation code, then sign in to create the admin user.
docker compose exec airlock cat /var/lib/airlock/activation_code.txt
```

Open `https://your-domain.com` in a browser, paste the activation code, set up the admin account.

The activation code is single-use and the file is removed after a successful activation.

## Updating

```bash
cd airlock
git fetch --tags
git checkout vX.Y.Z          # check the release notes for breaking changes first
docker compose up -d --build
```

Migrations run automatically on airlock startup. Always `pg_dump` before a major version bump if you care about your data.

## What it does

- **Agent runtime** — agents are user-written Go programs that import [agentsdk](https://github.com/airlockrun/agentsdk). airlock builds them into Docker images and runs each as a long-lived container, reaped when idle.
- **Triggers** — webhook ingress (`POST /webhooks/{agent}/...`), cron schedules, chat-platform bridges, custom HTTP routes on `{slug}.your-domain.com`.
- **LLM proxy** — agents call LLMs through airlock, which injects credentials per-agent and (optionally) routes through [telescope](https://github.com/airlockrun/telescope) for inspection.
- **Storage** — per-agent S3 buckets (via MinIO) for files; per-agent Postgres schema for relational data.
- **Tools** — built-in (HTTP, search, web fetch, file ops) plus MCP server integration.
- **Real-time** — WebSocket stream of build events, tool calls, deltas; replay buffer for reconnects.
- **RBAC** — tenant roles (admin / manager / user) and per-agent membership (admin / user / public).

Agents launched by airlock join the same Docker network and reach `airlock:8080`, `postgres:5432`, `minio:9000` by service name.

## Security

**Reporting vulnerabilities:** email `security@airlock.run`. **Do not** open a public issue.

**What's protected by default:**
- AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption for provider API keys, OAuth tokens, webhook secrets (with rotation support).
- Per-`(email, ip)` login throttling with constant-time response padding (closes both lockout-detection and email-enumeration timing channels).
- TLS for all public traffic (Caddy, on-demand certs from Let's Encrypt).
- JWT-scoped credentials per agent container; agents cannot access other agents' data.

**Known gaps in v1** (planned, not done):
- **MFA** is not implemented. A determined attacker rotating IPs can probe admin credentials without tripping the per-`(email, ip)` lockout. Mitigate with strong admin passwords and (recommended) putting airlock behind an edge proxy that does per-IP rate limiting (Cloudflare, fastly, your own nginx).
- **Per-IP rate limiting** is intentionally not in airlock — your reverse proxy or CDN does this better. The Caddy in this compose handles TLS but not DDoS protection.
- **Email notifications** on suspicious activity require SMTP, which the self-host doesn't bundle.
