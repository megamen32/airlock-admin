# AGENTS.md — how this agent is built

This file describes how this agent is structured: the file layout, the
MVC split, the build chain, and the high-level UI conventions. It is the
authoritative reference for *this* repo's shape.

> **Managed by the scaffold — do not edit.** It is regenerated from the
> scaffold template (airlock does this on every build; `go tool air update`
> does it in a standalone checkout), so edits here are overwritten. Put
> agent-specific decisions in `NOTES.md`, which the tooling never touches.

Two other documents complete the picture:

- **The agentsdk API reference** — every `Register*` function,
  the LLM-calling APIs, seal/unseal, built-in JS bindings, the full surface;
  deep-dive companions (`reference/`) cover storage, remote exec, live integration
  validation, interactive-login pages, and the database. In a plain checkout,
  read `.airlock/toolchain/skills/agentsdk/SKILL.md`; the airlock toolserver
  mounts the same version-matched source at `/libs/agentsdk/REFERENCE.md`.
  Read it for "what does the SDK give me?" — read this file for "how do I wire
  it together?".
- **`NOTES.md`** — the agent-specific design log. Decisions made for
  *this* agent (chosen integrations, non-obvious trade-offs, the
  styling palette, anything a future upgrade needs to know about).
  Keep it short and current as you go.

## What "an app" usually means

Requests are often a single line — "build me a Spotify app", "a kanban
board", or just "I want an app". Unless the user clearly asks for something
narrower (one chat tool, a webhook, a recurring job), read "app" as **a web app
plus the tools that drive it**, not one or the other:

- A **web UI** — templ + htmx pages (see the HTML UI section) the user opens
  in a browser to see and manipulate their data.
- **LLM-callable tools** (`RegisterTool`) over the *same* domain, so the agent
  can do the same things conversationally (Telegram / Discord / web chat).
- The **state, connections, and jobs** that domain needs behind both.

The UI and the tools are two faces of one domain layer (`service.go`) — build
both against it. A bare tool with no UI, or a UI the agent can't operate over
chat, is usually half of what the user pictured. When the request is vague,
pick a concrete domain, build the full web-app-plus-tools shape, and record the
assumption in `NOTES.md`.

**Keep `main.go` thin.** `newAgent()` is the definition-only composition root:
register SDK handles, construct services, inject those values directly into
each consuming package's constructor, and register bound handler and tool
methods. It must not read runtime environment, execute database operations,
make network calls, or start goroutines. `agentsdk.New` performs none of that
runtime work, and Airlock invokes the same factory offline to obtain the
canonical manifest. Business logic lives in domain packages, never inline in
main. `main()` only calls `newAgent().Serve()`; `Serve` freezes declarations,
starts runtime dependencies and migrations, syncs with Airlock, runs named
process-local `OnStart` hooks, and then serves.

`Agent.DB()` and registration APIs return late-bound handles that are safe to
pass into constructors in `newAgent`. Operations on runtime-backed handles are
unavailable until startup. Use `OnStart(name, hook)` for disposable
process-local initialization that needs the started and synchronized runtime;
durable work belongs in a registered job. `Agent.Manifest()` freezes and returns
the complete canonical declaration, and `AIRLOCK_AGENT_MODE=manifest` emits it
without runtime environment, database, migrations, or network.

Connected-machine integrations put each executable in `connectors/<slug>` and
shared typed definitions in an importable non-`main` contract package. Declare
a distinctive reverse-domain contract ID and explicit targets; support Linux
on amd64, arm64, and ARMv7 plus macOS and Windows on amd64 and arm64 unless the
integration is inherently platform-specific. Airlock-built connectors must be pure Go and compile with
`CGO_ENABLED=0`. Use direct Go APIs or typed process arguments, never shell
interpolation. Expose only narrow commands and selected roots through
`connector.LocalDirectory`; settings, credentials, machine paths, and
installation tokens remain local and never enter source or artifacts. Every
connector must explicitly select `connector.ServiceUser` or
`connector.ServiceSystem`; system-mode configuration and self-test run as the
eventual service identity before activation. macOS targets require
`connector.ServiceUser`; macOS system services are unsupported. Runtime
manifests and heartbeats
report the actual executable SHA-256. Upgrades retain a local binary/state
rollback, migrate compatible settings through candidate-typed flags, and
validate staged settings under the service identity before replacement. Never
write a candidate schema with `configure` before `upgrade`; noninteractive
upgrades must provide every reported required flag. The retained state is
exposed through the connector's `rollback` lifecycle command. Read
`reference/connectors.md` before adding a connector.

macOS artifacts produced by this build are unsigned and not notarized. Publish
their SHA-256 values and instruct users to verify the exact artifact before any
narrow `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <file>` operation; never recommend a
recursive quarantine removal. Use `ServiceUser` for TCC-sensitive desktop
integrations. A user LaunchAgent can request permissions in the graphical user
session, subject to macOS privacy approval for the installed executable.

## MVC: handlers are the integration point

The scaffold uses an MVC split for the HTML UI. As the agent grows, you'll
add domain packages and HTTP handlers; the rule below keeps the package
graph cycle-free.

```
main.go      →   <domain> (model)
                 handlers (controller) → <domain> + views
                 views (view)
```

- **Model** — domain packages (`spotify/`, `kanban/`, `weather/`). Pure
  Go: types, business logic, API calls. Never imports `views/` or
  `handlers/`.
- **View** — `views/` holds templ templates plus view-model types
  (`views.HomeView`, `views.BoardView`). Templates take view-model
  types only; `views/` never imports a domain package.
- **Controller** — `handlers/` holds a constructed receiver with HTTP methods
  (`pages.Home`, `pages.BoardPage`). It imports domain packages and `views/`,
  does the model→view-model conversion, and renders. Nothing imports
  `handlers/` back.

**If you find yourself wanting to import `views` from a domain
package, the handler is in the wrong place — move it to `handlers/`.**
That single rule prevents the cycle that would otherwise form:
domain → views → domain.

## Domain package shape

Dependencies are values, not a shared package. Use direct constructor parameters
for one or two dependencies and a package-local `Deps` struct for larger sets.
`main.go` constructs each service or SDK handle once and passes it directly to
consumers. Omitted wiring fails when `newAgent` compiles; nil required values
panic immediately in constructors.

**A domain package must never import a package that imports that domain.** In
particular, domain packages never import `handlers/`; handlers may import the
domain and adapt its types for views. Do not move shared dependencies into a
package imported by both sides if that package imports either consumer.

Each domain package has two layers:

1. **Pure Go** — business logic, API calls. Accepts handles, returns
   plain types.
2. **Tool receiver** — a `Tools` type constructed with the domain service, with
   `func (t *Tools) Name(ctx, In) (Out, error)` methods that call the pure
   layer. Register those bound methods with `RegisterTool`.

A typical domain package:

```
spotify/
├── service.go  # NewService(...) + methods returning plain types
└── tools.go    # NewTools(service) + bound RegisterTool targets
```

LLM-callable tools live in `tools.go`. HTTP routes live in `handlers/`.
Both consume the pure layer in `service.go`; neither imports the other.

```go
// feature/tools.go
type Tools struct{ service *Service }

func NewTools(service *Service) *Tools {
    if service == nil {
        panic("feature: service is required")
    }
    return &Tools{service: service}
}

func (t *Tools) List(ctx context.Context, in ListIn) (ListOut, error) {
    return t.service.List(ctx, in)
}

// main.go
featureService := feature.NewService(featureHandle)
featureTools := feature.NewTools(featureService)
pages := handlers.New(handlers.Deps{Feature: featureService})
agent.RegisterTool(tool.Typed[ListIn, ListOut]("list").
    Description("List items.").Execute(featureTools.List).Build(), agentsdk.AccessUser)
```

Use relative paths (`/auth`, `/settings`) for links within the same agent UI.
`agentsdk.AgentURL()` / `agentsdk.AgentURLFromContext(ctx)` return the agent's
public origin for absolute URLs that leave the request context, such as emails,
third-party callbacks, or chat messages. These accessors are unavailable during
definition and offline manifest inspection. `agenttest.New` returns a synced
agent; render pages so they can omit absolute links when the URL is unavailable
in narrower unit tests.

## Build chain

Every time you change a query, `.templ`, `styles/app.css`, or Go source, run the
local build before declaring the build done:

```bash
go tool air build
```

That runs the chain end-to-end:

```bash
remove prior sqlc-generated files from internal/db
.airlock/toolchain/bin/sqlc generate
go mod tidy
.airlock/toolchain/bin/sqlc generate # only when db/queries/*.sql exists
go tool templ generate
.airlock/toolchain/bin/tailwindcss -i styles/app.css -o views/static/app.css --minify
go test -p=1 -count=1 ./...
go build -buildvcs=false -o <temporary-path> .
discover immediate connectors/<slug>, validate each native manifest, and cross-compile declared targets with CGO_ENABLED=0
```

The temporary binary is removed after compilation, so the source tree stays
clean.

`go mod tidy` runs FIRST. Airlock bumps `agentsdk`'s required version in
`go.mod` before each build (so the build resolves against the current
SDK), but it doesn't touch `go.sum` — so the chain has to reconcile the
sums before `go tool templ generate` can resolve the templ tool
dependency. Putting tidy first turns the trial-and-error you'd
otherwise hit ("missing go.sum entry…") into a single clean pass.

Not committed (local and Docker builds regenerate them):
- `*_templ.go` — regenerated from `.templ`
- `views/static/app.css` — regenerated by tailwindcss
- `internal/db/*` except `internal/db/doc.go` — regenerated by sqlc when query
  inputs exist
- `/agent` and `/agent.exe` — root binaries from ad-hoc local builds
- `.airlock/toolchain/` — installed locally by `go tool air toolchain install`

Commit `.templ`, `styles/app.css`, `db/queries/*.sql`, and
`internal/db/doc.go`. A fresh clone + `docker build .` regenerates sqlc,
templ, and Tailwind output before compiling.

## Testing

Write Go tests for what you add. The build runs
`go test -p=1 -count=1 ./...` so cached successes cannot hide a regression and
packages sharing `$TEST_DB_URL` cannot reset the schema concurrently. A failing
test means the build isn't done. Keep the suite focused: test
complex logic, regressions, and important route behavior, not every function or
handler by default.

Tests must not load secrets, connection credentials, or MCP credentials from
`.env` or the developer's environment. Secrets stay in Airlock. Use
`agenttest.New(t, newAgent)` and its mock Airlock for agent-level tests.

- **Unit tests** sit next to the code they cover, one `_test.go` per source
  file: `<domain>/service_test.go` for business logic, `handlers/home_test.go`
  for handler rendering. Construct the receiver with typed test dependencies
  and invoke the method directly. Use table-driven subtests with `t.Run`.
- **Agent composition smoke tests** live in `main_test.go`. Build the agent with
  `agenttest.New(t, newAgent)` and serve `env.Agent.Handler()` through
  `httptest` so a small request set proves the complete dependency graph,
  routes, and static declarations are wired. The helper stands up a mock
  Airlock and selects a test database only after it invokes `newAgent` with
  runtime environment cleared. It then starts the runtime, validates migrations
  with an up, down-to-zero, up cycle, syncs declarations, runs named `OnStart`
  hooks, and returns a ready agent:

  ```go
  func TestAgentComposition(t *testing.T) {
      env := agenttest.New(t, newAgent)
      user := agentsdk.User{ID: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"}
      req := httptest.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, "/", nil)
      req = req.WithContext(agenttest.WithUser(req.Context(), user))
      rec := httptest.NewRecorder()
      env.Agent.Handler().ServeHTTP(rec, req)
      // assert status, content type, body
  }
  ```

  Use `agenttest.WithUser` for ordinary authenticated users and
  `agenttest.WithCaller` when the test needs explicit public, user, or admin
  access. Do not set `X-User-*` or `X-Caller-Access`; those are private transport
  details. Context values do not cross an `httptest.NewServer` network boundary,
  so caller-sensitive tests invoke `env.Agent.Handler()` in process.

  Keep this test as a narrow composition check. Put detailed route behavior in
  the handler package and detailed domain behavior beside its service. Exercise
  render tests in the empty/resting state (no rows, nil pointers), where view
  failures commonly occur.
- **DB-backed tests:** `agenttest.New` uses `$TEST_DB_URL` only when supplied;
  otherwise it starts a throwaway `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` container. It never
  connects to an inherited `$AIRLOCK_DB_URL`. The factory may wire the
  late-bound `agent.DB()` into dependency constructors but must not query it.
  `go tool air build` supplies one shared throwaway database to the serial
  package test run, avoiding one container per `agenttest.New` call.
  After the factory returns, startup validates source migrations with an up,
  down-to-zero, up cycle from the enclosing module's `db/migrations`, including
  when the test belongs to a subpackage. Never change process cwd to find migrations.
  `agenttest.New` returns only after sync and `OnStart` hooks, so tests can use
  the migrated database immediately. The helper closes the pool and test
  services during cleanup.

  ```go
  func TestThing(t *testing.T) {
      env := agenttest.New(t, newAgent)
      q := db.New(env.Agent.DB())
      // exercise queries, assert results
  }
  ```
- `go test` can exceed the default bash timeout on a cold cache — pass a larger
  `timeout` when you run it.

## Database

Migrations live under `db/migrations/`. Use SQL for schema changes and Go
migrations only for bounded PostgreSQL work that requires Go logic. Storage,
HTTP, credential, and other external data changes belong in observable durable
jobs over an expand/migrate/contract layout; never perform them from goose or
`OnStart`. Use sequential goose names
(`NNN_short_description.sql` or `.go`). Query files under `db/queries/` are sqlc
input; each `-- name: FuncName :one|:many|:exec` block becomes a typed Go
function in `internal/db/`.

For SQL-only migrations, validate locally when `$TEST_DB_URL` is set:

```bash
goose -dir db/migrations postgres "$TEST_DB_URL" up
goose -dir db/migrations postgres "$TEST_DB_URL" reset
goose -dir db/migrations postgres "$TEST_DB_URL" up
psql "$TEST_DB_URL" -c "\dt"  # verify final schema shape
```

The standalone goose CLI cannot register Go migrations. When any numbered `.go`
migration exists, use `go tool air build` for source verification; Airlock runs
the compiled agent image through up, down, and up before deployment.

## Dockerfile & system setup

**Never modify `Dockerfile`** — Airlock regenerates it. System packages,
language runtimes, and binary tools the agent needs at runtime go in
`setup.sh`, which runs as root at image build time and is baked into
the runtime image. Example:

```bash
# setup.sh
apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ffmpeg
# Drop tool binaries under /var/agent/bin/ — already on PATH at runtime.
```

After editing `setup.sh`, verify the tools it installs actually run before
relying on them. In the airlock toolserver:

```bash
sudo run-setup && <new-binary> --version
```

## HTML UI — short

Stack: `templ` (type-safe HTML) + `htmx` (interactivity) + Tailwind v4 +
DaisyUI (styling and busy indicators) + Lucide (icons). htmx is served same-origin by the framework under
`agentsdk.Assets.HTMX`; the compiled Tailwind stylesheet is served from
the agent's own `/static/app.{hash}.css` URL after `newAgent` passes its embedded
bytes to `agentsdk.RegisterStaticAsset`.

**Read the version-matched `agentsdk`, `templ`, `htmx`, `daisyui`, and `lucide` skill
references before writing code** — each carries its API or language/library
reference. In a plain checkout, `go tool air update` refreshes their entry
  points at `.airlock/toolchain/skills/{agentsdk,templ,htmx,daisyui,lucide}/SKILL.md`;
`go tool air toolchain install` installs them directly. In the airlock
toolserver, load the UI references through the `skill` tool and read the SDK at
`/libs/agentsdk/REFERENCE.md`. The gotchas below are the high-frequency traps;
the skills have the full rules. templ markup is not a Go function body and an
`hx-*` swap is not a free-form DOM write — when in doubt, read the skill, don't
guess.

Design principles:

- **Pick a tone before writing markup.** Music dashboard, weather
  agent, admin console — each earns a distinct aesthetic. Decide
  first; build to it. A centered title + three buttons is the stock-
  demo trap.
- **Mobile-first.** Design for narrow viewports, then add `sm:` /
  `md:` / `lg:` variants for wider screens. Test at ~375px before
  declaring done.
- **Brand through DaisyUI's theme**, not per-element overrides.
  Set the theme in `styles/app.css` (see **Theming** below). Don't
  sprinkle `bg-[#...]` or inline `style=` colours through templates.
- **Show the domain.** Render real data prominently — album art,
  weather illustrations, charts. Emoji-as-title-decoration is a
  placeholder you replaced.
- **Give action buttons an idle icon.** Use the complete Lucide catalog through
  `github.com/airlockrun/agentsdk/lucide`; do not paste SVG paths, load an icon
  CDN, or use emoji as interface icons. Labeled buttons keep their text. Icon-only
  buttons need an `sr-only` label on the button.
- **A loading slot is never empty at rest.** For htmx action buttons, render
  `@ActionIcon("domain-appropriate-name")` before the label and add
  `hx-disabled-elt="this"`. The component overlays the Lucide idle icon and
  DaisyUI spinner at identical dimensions. Leave the request indicator on the
  requesting element so its `htmx-request` class switches the two; do not point
  `hx-indicator` at a remote element. If `views/icons.templ` is absent, create
  it from the version-matched Lucide skill.
- **The web app IS the product — don't explain it, build it.** The web UI
  is the user's web-side control surface over the same domain they also
  drive from chat. They already know both exist and that changes sync, so
  don't narrate that relationship or the mechanics: no "Chat controls"
  panel, no "ask the agent in chat to do X", no "this page refreshes so
  chat-side changes appear here", no meta tagline describing what the agent
  is. Skip filler stat badges that just restate what's already on screen.
  Never surface the agent's plumbing — tool inventory, model/SDK names,
  internal IDs. Just build the genuinely useful, operable product and make
  the web side as capable for the domain as chat is. If a line only makes
  sense to someone who knows this is an LLM agent, it doesn't belong in the
  UI.
- **templ control flow is only `if` / `else` / `switch` / `for` — there is
  no early `return`.** A bare `return` inside a templ block is not an exit;
  templ writes it to the page as the literal text "return" and the
  surrounding markup still renders. To show one of several states, use a
  single `if / else if / else` chain — never `if cond { …markup… return }`,
  which renders every matching block plus stray "return" text.
- **Don't double-wrap htmx swap targets.** Either the page owns the
  card and the partial swaps inner content, or the partial owns the
  card and the page renders only an empty target. Picking both
  produces two stacked headers and a card-in-a-card border.
- **Static JS handlers are quoted literals, not `{ }` expressions.**
  Write `onclick="my_modal.showModal()"` — templ emits it verbatim. The
  `onclick={ "…" }` brace form types the value as `templ.ComponentScript`,
  so a plain string won't compile and you'd be pushed to
  `templ.JSUnsafeFuncCall`. Prefer htmx for behavior; reserve inline JS
  for trivial DOM calls like opening a `<dialog>`.
- **Record styling decisions in `NOTES.md`** — chosen theme name (or
  custom palette tokens), font family + where it's loaded from,
  layout conventions you committed to. The next rebuild should see
  what you decided.

### Theming

DaisyUI ships ~35 built-in themes. **Pick the one that fits the app's tone
and use it — don't hand-author a palette.** The installed `daisyui-config`
skill lists the version-matched built-in themes. Set the chosen themes in
`styles/app.css` and on the page:

```css
@plugin "../.airlock/toolchain/lib/tailwind/daisyui.mjs" {
  themes: winter --default, night --prefersdark;
}
```
```html
<html data-theme="winter">   <!-- or omit and rely on --default -->
```

Plugins load from the repo-local toolchain path — don't `npm i daisyui` or use
the bare `@plugin "daisyui"` name (it doesn't resolve here); the daisyUI
skills' bare-name examples need this path translation.

For light branding you may retint a built-in theme by reusing its name
and overriding a token or two — `@plugin
"../.airlock/toolchain/lib/tailwind/daisyui-theme.mjs" { name: "winter"; --color-primary: …; }`
inherits the rest. (A native Tailwind `@theme {}` block does *not*
retint daisyUI components.) Authoring a full theme from scratch is
rarely worth it.

## Updating the UI

The web UI is action-driven first: a user's POST swaps its own response, so the
page reflects what they just did. That covers most updates and disrupts nobody.

State also changes from outside the page — the other surface (the user told the
bot "add a card" in chat) or live data (now-playing, a feed). To pick that up,
**poll, but never re-swap unchanged content.** A periodic swap that replaces a
region resets scroll, focus, and in-progress drags — the classic "it scrolled me
back to the top every few seconds" bug.

Make the poll conditional: give the data an updated-at (or version), have the
polling request carry what it last saw (a query param or header you set — htmx
does not send `If-Modified-Since` for you), and in the handler **return `204 No
Content` when nothing changed.** htmx treats 204 as "do nothing", so an idle page
never re-swaps and scroll/focus is left alone; return `200` with the fragment
only on a real change. Use **204, not 304** — htmx swaps 3xx responses, so a 304
would blank the target; 204 is its built-in no-swap code.

```
<div id="np" hx-get="/now-playing?since=0" hx-trigger="every 5s" hx-swap="outerHTML">…</div>
```
```go
// nothing new since the client's last-seen version → tell htmx to do nothing
if r.URL.Query().Get("since") == currentVersion {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNoContent) // 204
    return
}
// changed → render the replacement div carrying the current version; outerHTML
// swaps it in, so the next poll sends since=<current> and idles on 204 again
```

When a real change does swap, don't yank the user around: swap the smallest
region that changed (or out-of-band swaps of just the changed items), not the
whole scroll container. Mark an element that must survive untouched with
`hx-preserve` (a media player, a focused input); to refresh a region in place
while keeping scroll and selection, use a morph swap (idiomorph) rather than
replacing it.

For a page that isn't live and only needs to catch cross-surface edits (which
happen while the user is away in chat), refresh-on-focus is a fine, lighter
alternative to polling:

```
hx-trigger="visibilitychange[document.visibilityState === 'visible'] from:document"
```
