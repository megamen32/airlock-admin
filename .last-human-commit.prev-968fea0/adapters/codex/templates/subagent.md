# Codex subagent instructions template

Before every `spawn_agent` or resumed Worker call:

Bootstrap the child with exactly `<Role> <absolute-task-file-path>`.

- Select the lowest sufficient working model class; do not inherit L's model by
  default.
- Every new child starts with `fork_context: false`. Never fork parent history;
  pass only required context explicitly.
- Send one compact assignment: role, Worker mode when applicable, root task path,
  goal, decisive evidence, allowed/excluded paths, one
  acceptance check, minimum/maximum with maximum <=20, stop conditions, and
  compact return format.
- The child reads only the assigned task file, appends detailed evidence
  and its result there, and returns only TL;DR to L. It never creates a second
  task card, report, ledger, or spec file.
- After 3 active minutes of research orientation, write the exact query and
  detailed answer to named files: ignored `.agents/shared-session/search/<task-id>/search-<task-slug>.md`
  and tracked `.agents/shared-session/results/<task-id>/result-<result-slug>.md`;
  chat carries only a compact TL;DR and paths.
- Resume the same Worker from research with `send_input` for its selected
  implementation lane when supported; otherwise pass the compact Research
  section to a fresh Worker.
- Overseer continues the persistent shared-session context; use fresh/no-history
  only for recovery or an explicitly requested independent audit. Critic is a
  fresh no-history child with no desired verdict from L. Reviewer and Tester are fresh independent
  gates as required by their roles.
- Escalate only after `NEEDS_REDECOMPOSITION`, `NEEDS_RETHINK`, or concrete
  acceptance evidence proves a capability gap.

If the active Codex surface cannot create a no-history gate child, report the
unsupported boundary instead of using a history-forked substitute.
