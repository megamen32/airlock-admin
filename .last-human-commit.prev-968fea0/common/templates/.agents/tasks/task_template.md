  Minimum proof to proceed:

## Child assignment and detailed report — append-only

The explicit `<Role> <absolute-task-file-path>` bootstrap is authoritative.
The child reads only this assigned task file. Children append their detailed
evidence and result to that file, then return only TL;DR to L. Children never create a second task
card, report, ledger, specification, or recovery file.
